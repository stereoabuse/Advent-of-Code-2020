Goals for this year include learning git and PyCharm.
                             
                             
### [Day 01](solutions/day_01.py)
I finished 200th in part 1 and 1133 in part 2.  Unfortunately I got a `503 error` for a bit over one minute but still 
happy with how I did so far.  I solved this with a simple naive double or triple for-loop, checking to make sure that 
the values for each entry was unique and returning the product when the two loops found the right sum.

I also hacked together a solution in Julia
